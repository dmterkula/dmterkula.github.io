I found portions of this reading helpful and informative, yet I found other sections almost entirely confusing or unclear.
This text seems written to already established software engineers or developers, and not the novice level. This reading
outlines 12 factors important for developing web apps, and most of the examples references languages I don't know or
haven't used or other services or dev tools that I've never heard of. Despite these barriers some of the text made sense.

The discussion about codebases made sense and in our class we are using a central repo for our projects so it wasn't hard
to grasp the need for a single code base for a larger scale app that many devs may work on, like the class project we will
be working on. I found that the section on dependencies supported the class discussion about the necessity to isolate
dependencies from the classes or services that use them. I found the discussion about dev parity to be interesting and useful
as well. this section highlighted the need for dev and those that implement the services they create to be using the same
tools to ease the process of getting the code into production. Developers should work closely with the ops people who
will be releasing the code to expedite the process of releasing code. The section on logs and logging went into detail
about the important of tracking event happening in the app and tracking its performance, which aligns with the requirements
to include logging in this weeks assignment. Another interesting takeaway was the section on configs which stated the
importance of keeping the code independent of the config state and not having the config state depend on the code. There
can many different configs for an app, it would be horrible to have to code outlined for each possibility.

Some sections however didn't make much sense to me and I didn't get any great benefit from reading them. The sections on concurrency
and admin processes particularly were confusing and obscure and I couldn't follow the bulk of the discussion past what these
things are at very simple level. As mentioned before, the examples provided in these sections didn't help those who were unfamiliar
with any or many dev tools and didn't help to alieve any confusion.
