Pragmatic Programmer: The Basic Tools
    </p>
    <p>
This section of the book discussed many tools which can be used to improve programmer productivity. Some of these tools include
text editors, IDEs, graphical user interfaces, debuggers, etc. However, the authors mention that some of these tools can be a
crutch and a hindrance depending on the project. Specifically, the authors discuss how writing and editing code in only GUIs and
IDEs can limit what a programmer can do with a certain task as writing code in the command line or the shell can be much more
efficient and powerful to handle certain tasks as it operates closer to the machine level. I found this interesting but not yet
true at the level of code and projects I have been writing, but it makes sense why professors have been trying to integrate the
command line for execution now.

The authors recommended keeping knowledge in a plaintext format such as HTML and XML which are human readable and to some
extent human understandable. The authors recommend this because plain text formatting will never be obsolete and information
stored in them can easily be understood if needed in the future versus using some unreadable format or coding language that
may go obsolete. The authors concede that using plaintext can be inefficient in terms of space and computability; however,
I agree with them that it is safer to store knowledge in a form that can be accessed and understood through time and
technological evolution.

The authors also discussed the importance of using one code editor and getting very familiar with it such that it is an
extension of your own hand so editing code quickly becomes second nature. I agree with this philosophy to a point,
because what if editors go out of style or don’t get updated anymore or for some reason go obsolete? I think
being proficient at a couple would be useful and safe as well.

Other tools the authors discuss are debuggers, code generators, and some form of source code control. Our software engineering
class has begun using unit testing and a debugger, which is actually pretty useful. Debuggers allow one to step through
code and visualize the variables and the data that may be causing errors. Debuggers can help a programmer find what is
wrong with code, because I agree with the quote that the authors cite in regards to programming that says: “the easiest
person to deceive is oneself.” Therefore, along with a Debugger, a second pair of eyes can be very useful in catching a
bug in a program and can safe lots of time. Source code control can help in case one cannot find bugs and it is easy then
to go back to previous versions of the software that works. This can really be necessary if you can’t figure out where the
bug is, and if you didn’t keep old versions, than you’re straight out of luck. Code generators can automate processes easily,
such as converting java to C++ or some other language which I thought was very useful and I didn’t know (but guessed) such things
existed.
