What Does Software Engineering Mean to Me?
    </p>
    <p>
After reading Chapter one in the Pragmatic Programmer, I feel as if I have a better understanding of what it means to be a
software engineer. Being a software engineer is more than just being a cog in the machine or being simply a programmer.
Rather, a software engineer is a team member that is responsible for developing code and managing others to code to create
applications. Software engineers resemble engineers in other fields, such as civil engineers, in the sense that they must
always keep the final product in mind when creating there project. And lastly, I see software engineers now as business
men at the end of the day, or they are motivated by the interests of the business men they work for. Ultimately, all
these aspects are a piece of what software engineering means to me.

Software engineers typically work in teams to develop code into a final product for consumers of some variety.
Many team members writing code means that each developer needs to keep their code clean and readable for their
team members who might use them, as well as keeping their source code organized (through GitHub for instance).
If one developer doesn’t take the time to take care of their code and make it readily readable or usable, then
the team may suffer the consequences of the “Broken Window Theory.” This theory states that nice things will
stay nice because people will respect them; however, as soon as there is a ‘chip’, ‘a crack’, or a ‘broken window’
in the something, (say someone’s code), then the community there developers will start to no respect the thing in
question (their collective application). Each team member must value their own work or risk everyone writing poor
code and the project going south in a hurry

Software engineering also includes keeping the finished product in mine when developing and making sure that is
communicated to all team members. Ideally, each new feature the software would be branched off of the main branch,
until it is finished, tested, and ready to be merged back on to the final branch. If developers don’t have a
solidified idea of what the final version of the application is going to look like than certain branches may
not merge well because some coders may have made certain features not to specifications. Therefore, it is very
important that all developers are on the same page of the specifications of the final project. Software engineering
thus centers on making plans and goals, communicating them well, and working to meet those plans as accurately and
efficiently as possible.

Software engineering and its processes are also influenced by business schedules and motivations. Suppose one works
for the health care company Humana. Humana hires programmers and developers to create applications to facilitate how
they provide health insurance. Humana’s executives and general management will set a deadline for the developers to
produce an application. Working on a deadline forces developers sometimes to have to submit or create ‘imperfect
software’ or “good enough software.” Good enough software may not meet the exact specifications of the model or as
promised to consumers, but it will get the job done and the features left out will be released in the next version.
Business deadlines will influence what quality of software is developed and on what timeline. Software engineering
thus means working under these deadlines and doing the best one can, even if that means “good enough software.”
