Mythical Man Month Reading Response
    </p>
    <p>
I found this text to be easier to read and more useful than some of the past texts; I think some of this practical knowledge
is just as important, if not more so, than some of the technical skills. One of the things that resonated with me most was
the concept that adding man power to a task doesn't always help, or in some cases, even bogs progress down further. This concept
in the economics world is known as the law of diminishing returns; this law applies in this case becuase the more men one
adds to project, the less and less return to saved time there is. If too many men are added, then the resulting time saved is
is actually negative (as time is lost) and there is negative returns to adding too much man power. The author cited that one
of the main reasons for the noticed diminishing returns is that communiction across team members for non-indpendent tasks takes
work and hence time, especially when requirements or specs are subject to change. I also appreciated the author's analogy of
software engineers to chefs, you can only rush the process a little, without sacrificing the quality. Too much rushing by 
turning up the heat or pressure is going to burn or under-cook the final product, making it unedible, (or unusable).

The author also discussed why software projects most often fail, which is due to running out of time, or making too many
sacrifices to testing or quality to deliver a project on time. This primarily happens due to poor estimating skills. I agree
with the author that too many times people are too optomistic and don't account for bugs in their code; people like to believe
that they write code well and without many errors, which is almost never the case. I also agree witht he author that lots of
time for a project should be for planning and testing of code. The actual coding shouldn't take that long if you know what you
are doing and have a solid (and correct) idea and implementation in your head.
