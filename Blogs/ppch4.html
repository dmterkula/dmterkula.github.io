Pragmatic Programmer Chapter 4: Pragmatic Paranoia Response
    </p>
    <p>
I appreciated how this chapter opened with the fact that no one, especially ourselves, can write perfect software. This realization
leads to the fact that developers should practice coding defensively, especially against oneself. Part of defensive programing is
creating contracts for each part of code, whether is be with classes, each method, etc. Our class has emphasized this philosophy
by encouraging the use of interfaces pretty much all the time. However, the text also advocates using a contractual approach
with each method by providing pre and post-condition documentation before each method and checking within the code to make
sure these conditions are met; this method can eliminate a lot of error from others trying to use code, and with oneself when
trying to fulfill the post-condition. One way of making sure pre and post-conditions are met is to use assertions, which we used
in our test classes during unit and integration tests. Using a contractual approach is also useful when using inheritance because
it allows the user of the code to call a method that may belong to the super class and not really care what the specific instance
of the class that is using it is, despite that is has the functionality of the parent.

The author also discussed another benefit to coding defensively and checking for errors, is that crashing a program early is
a lot better than having to trash a program later because of deeply embedded errors that weren't supposed to happen. The use of
exceptions and throwing them can help catch errors that are truly exceptionally and shouldn't be happening, especially in regards
to resource handling, such as database interactions and reading and writing to files. In addition, any resources use, should
be deallocated within the same block of code that allocated it so that there are no memory leaks or other ways for this resource
to be mishandled down the course of the program. One should always check to be sure that resources are freed up and not just
assuming that they are, and this can be done with assertions and other forms of error handling. All in all this was a very helpful
section of the text for me as on the class project i was responsible for testing and if we coded defensively, my job would have
been a lot easier.
